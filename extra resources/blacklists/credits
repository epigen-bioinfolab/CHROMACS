# About the exclusion regions ("blacklists"):
The blacklist regions of the genome are problematic regions which consistently exhibit abnormally
high backgroud signal or artifactual read enrichment. Often arise from repetitive elements, low 
mappability, or unannotated structural variants that cause reads to align incorrectly. To minimize
the false positives and improve the biological interpretability of peak calling, such problematic
regions are typically masked using genomic blacklists or exclusion regions.

# How ChromAcS handles blacklists:
ChromAcS allows users to specify a blacklist (BED) file during peak calling. However, this is 
completely optional, as in many organisms the blacklists have not been well-curated or published.

# How to assign the blacklists in ChromAcs:
Users must download or obtain the blacklist file and save it in their local device in a certain
directory. During step 4 (peak calling) of ChromAcs, users can browse and select the required 
blacklist file.

# !!! STRICT REQUIREMENT !!!
If users use their custom blacklist (that is, apart from the ones uploaded in our GitHub page), 
please ensure that the chromosome naming follows the ENSEMBL convention (that is , NO 'chr' should
be there before the chromosome names).

on blacklist, which we have slightly modified to match ChromAcS requirements. For GRCh38 blacklist,
